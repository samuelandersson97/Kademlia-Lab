# To do:
Timeout for network parts, such as ping or lookup (net.SetDeadline() could be used i think)  
Bugcheck node join  
ID are set when node joins (is this acceptable? or should they be set when node join executes)  
Debug node lookup, is not working properly  
Cases for nodelookup (keep track of visited nodes and so on..)  
Each node should have a hashtable  
Implement get & store
